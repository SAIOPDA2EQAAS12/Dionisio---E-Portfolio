<p align="center">
Learning HTML and CSS this school year was like unlocking a whole new world of possibilities.<br>
With HTML, I got to understand how websites are structured, and with CSS, I can jazz them up <br>
and make them look awesome. But it's not just about making cool websites; knowing these languages <br>
can land me jobs in web development, design, or digital marketing. Plus, coding taught me <br>
problem-solving and attention to detail, which are handy skills in everyday life. Best part? <br> 
As I was learning, I felt super accomplished and empowered to bring my creative ideas to life online, <br>
making my mark in the digital world.

1. This picture was one of my first days in LPSCI, I met a girl named Yvanne.<br>
   She's the sweetest person ever and she would always help me out when <br>
   I needed help when it comes to school works. I'm so grateful to have <br>
   her as a friend since we share some interests that helped foster our <br>
   friendship.

2. This day was really fun to me since I got to try playing volleyball <br>
  after a very long time of just focusing on studies and mainly <br>
  spending my time playing video games. It was such a peaceful <br>
  vibe to me just watching my friends play and getting to spend <br>
  time with them.

3. During the vpop contest back in december, it was so stressful for us since we were also<br>
   preparing for another contest held by the values club. Even though there was a lot of <br>
   misunderstandings during the practices and preparation for this event, we were still able <br>
   to push through and finish the performance with a smile on our faces. I think that <br> 
   this experience really taught us how to properly organize and practice team cooperation <br>
   in order to execute a great performance.

4. This was the other contest held by the values club which was called Mr. and Ms. MVP. <br>
   It was also very difficult to do since we had to make costumes out of recycled materials, <br>
   we also had to consider a lot of things like budgeting, time management and cooperation. <br>
   Although it was difficult, I know that I tried my best to do the best I could to help.

5. The highlight of my 9th grade experience would be the variety show for our ESP class.<br>
   Experiencing that with my classmates was such a fun moment because we were able to showcase <br>
   our talents in various ways. I did get sick which led me to back out from the waltz segment <br>
   but even tho it was like that, I was still able to accomplish my tasks as the documentation head.

6. We had a little activity during our english class with our adviser Ms. Gia <br>
   I probably would never forget those memories because everyone was so <br>
   competetive and happy. It was a random chill day and Ms. Gia made it <br>
   so exciting and enjoyable.

 I chose La Traviata as my magazine because <br>
 it is a timeless opera that tells the tragic <br>
 story of Violetta, a courtesan who finds true <br>
 love with Alfredo but is ultimately torn apart by <br>
 societal expectations and illness. As a student, <br>
 its narrative resonates deeply, exploring themes <br>
 of love, sacrifice, and societal norms. Violetta's <br>
 journey from a life of luxury to one of genuine love <br>
 and selflessness reflects the complexities of human <br>
 relationships and the struggle to balance personal desires<br>
 with societal pressures. Her character's depth and <br>
 vulnerability inspire introspection, urging me to reflect <br>
 on my own values and relationships. Through Violetta's story, <br>
 I am reminded of the importance of authenticity, empathy, and <br>
 resilience in navigating life's challenges. As I delve into the <br>
 opera's rich history and music, I am inspired not only to learn <br>
 about art and culture but also to seek deeper understanding and <br>
 connection with the world around me. <br>
